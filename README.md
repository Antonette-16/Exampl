The Process of Compiling and Running Code:
 
- Writing the Code: You begin by writing instructions in a specific programming language using a text editor or an IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- Compilation (for compiled languages): If the language is compiled (like C, C++, Java), a compiler translates your code into machine-readable instructions (machine code). This creates an executable file that can be run directly.
- Interpretation (for interpreted languages): If the language is interpreted (like Python, JavaScript, Ruby), an interpreter reads and executes your code line by line, without creating a separate executable file.
- Linking (optional): Sometimes, compiled code needs to be linked with libraries or other external code to form a complete executable.
- Execution: Once compiled or interpreted, the code can be run. The processor reads the machine code instructions and performs the tasks specified in your program.
